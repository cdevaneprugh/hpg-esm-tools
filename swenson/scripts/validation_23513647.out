COMPARISON: Our Implementation vs Swenson's Published Data
======================================================================

Note: Direct comparison is approximate because:
  - Our data: raw 90m pixels
  - Swenson's: discretized 16-column parameters at 0.9° x 1.25°
  - Our HAND/DTND should have similar DISTRIBUTIONS to Swenson's elevation/distance

--- Height/Elevation Statistics ---
  Our HAND mean:      10.3 m
  Swenson elev mean:  6.7 m
  Our HAND median:    3.6 m
  Swenson elev median:4.0 m
  Our HAND max:       609.4 m
  Swenson elev max:   70.8 m

--- Distance Statistics ---
  Our DTND mean:      1116.7 m
  Swenson dist mean:  263.3 m
  Our DTND median:    966.8 m
  Swenson dist median:255.2 m
  Our DTND max:       20138.1 m
  Swenson dist max:   702.0 m

--- River Network Statistics ---
  Our network length: 109549.2 km
  Our network slope:  0.173%
  Our main channel:   2267.7 km
  Swenson stream slope (region mean): 0.545%

--- Interpretation ---
  HAND/elevation ratio: 1.53
  DTND/distance ratio:  4.24
