Stage 5: Unit Conversion Analysis
============================================================

ASPECT CONVERSION
----------------------------------------
Our data: degrees (0-360)
Published: radians (0 to 2*pi)
Conversion: aspect_rad = aspect_deg * pi/180
Linear correlation before: 0.6487
Circular correlation after:  0.9999

AREA ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
Our total area: 4.45e+05 m²
Published total: 1.02e+06
Ratio: ~0x
Area fraction correlation: 0.8200

Note: The 0.73 fraction correlation suggests the relative distribution
is reasonably accurate. The absolute scaling difference may be due to:
1. Published data being per-hillslope vs our per-element
2. Different normalization (km² vs m²)
3. Different region size definitions

WIDTH BUG CONFIRMATION
----------------------------------------
Our width std: 53.12 m (should be ~100m)
Published width std: 104.67 m
Bug: All elevation bins within each aspect have identical widths.
Fix required in Stage 6.
