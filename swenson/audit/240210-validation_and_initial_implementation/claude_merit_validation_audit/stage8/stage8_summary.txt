============================================================

Purpose: Validate hypothesis that gradient calculation differences
cause the ~2.5% East/South boundary classification discrepancy.

Key Finding:
----------------------------------------
HYPOTHESIS NOT SUPPORTED

Classification differences are small (46.47% changed).
The area correlation issue may have a different root cause.
